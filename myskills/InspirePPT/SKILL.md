Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward.

# PPTX Skill

## Quick Reference

| Task | Guide |
|------|-------|
| Read/analyze content | `python -m markitdown presentation.pptx` |
| Edit or create from template | Read [editing.md](editing.md) |
| Create from scratch | Read [pptxgenjs.md](pptxgenjs.md) |

---

## Reading Content

```bash
# Text extraction
python -m markitdown presentation.pptx

# Visual overview
python scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx

# Raw XML
python scripts/office/unpack.py presentation.pptx unpacked/
```

---

## Editing Workflow

**Read [editing.md](editing.md) for full details.**

1. Analyze template with `thumbnail.py`
2. Unpack → manipulate slides → edit content → clean → pack

---

## Creating from Scratch

**Read [pptxgenjs.md](pptxgenjs.md) for full details.**

Use when no template or reference presentation is available.

## Design System (`pptstyle.json`)

**MANDATORY**: You must strictly use the design tokens defined in `templates/pptstyle.json` as your single source of truth for all styling decisions. **Never invent your own colors, font families, or sizes.**

### 1. The Rule Book: `pptstyle.json`
Before generating any slide via code, parse `templates/pptstyle.json`.
- **Colors**: Use `color_system.brand_primary` (e.g., `#1B2B47` Starry Blues, `#4A9FD8` Creative Blue) and `color_system.functional`.
- **Typography**: Apply exact fonts and sizes from `typography.hierarchy` (e.g., `h1` must use `MiSans SemiBold` 28pt). 
- **Layouts**: Follow `layout_grid` for margins (e.g., 48px top/bottom, 60px left/right).
- **Components**: Draw cards, badges, and callouts exactly as defined in the `components` section.

### 2. The Pattern Library: `SamplePPT.pptx`
If you need a visual reference for how a complex layout looks (e.g., a "case_study" or "interaction" page type defined in the JSON):
- Use `python scripts/thumbnail.py templates/SamplePPT.pptx` or `markitdown` to study the reference output.
- Recreate these structural patterns using `pptxgenjs` by combining rectangle shapes, text boxes, and icons.

### 3. The Master Canvas: `InspireTemplate.pptx`
When editing via XML (the `editing.md` workflow):
- Always use `templates/InspireTemplate.pptx` as your base template for unpacking.
- It contains existing layouts that match the JSON style. Find the matching slide structure, duplicate it, and replace its dummy text content.

### Visual Layout Rules
**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape. Text-only slides are forgettable.
- **Layout options**: Two-column (text left, illustration on right), Icon + text rows, 2x2 grid, Half-bleed image.
- **Visual polish**: Use badges (from JSON) and apply `pptstyle.json` callout styling (colored left border, light background) for key stats.
- **Spacing**: Follow `layout_grid.margin` from JSON (convert px to inches for pptxgenjs: 1 inch = 96px). Leave breathing room.

### Avoid (Common Mistakes)

- **Don't repeat the same layout** — vary columns, cards, and callouts across slides
- **Don't center body text** — left-align paragraphs and lists; center only titles
- **Don't skimp on size contrast** — titles need 36pt+ to stand out from 14-16pt body
- **Don't default to blue** — pick colors that reflect the specific topic
- **Don't mix spacing randomly** — choose 0.3" or 0.5" gaps and use consistently
- **Don't style one slide and leave the rest plain** — commit fully or keep it simple throughout
- **Don't create text-only slides** — add images, icons, charts, or visual elements; avoid plain title + bullets
- **Don't forget text box padding** — when aligning lines or shapes with text edges, set `margin: 0` on the text box or offset the shape to account for padding
- **Don't use low-contrast elements** — icons AND text need strong contrast against the background; avoid light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds
- **NEVER use accent lines under titles** — these are a hallmark of AI-generated slides; use whitespace or background color instead

## QA (Required)

**Assume there are problems. Your job is to find them.**

Your first render is almost never correct. Approach QA as a bug hunt, not a confirmation step. If you found zero issues on first inspection, you weren't looking hard enough.

### Content QA

```bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx
```

Check for missing content, typos, wrong order.

**When using templates, check for leftover placeholder text:**

```bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx | grep -iE "xxxx|lorem|ipsum|this.*(page|slide).*layout"
```

If grep returns results, fix them before declaring success.

### Visual QA

**⚠️ USE SUBAGENTS** — even for 2-3 slides. You've been staring at the code and will see what you expect, not what's there. Subagents have fresh eyes.

Convert slides to images (see [Converting to Images](#converting-to-images)), then use this prompt:

```
Visually inspect these slides. Assume there are issues — find them.

Look for:
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words, stacked elements)
- Text overflow or cut off at edges/box boundaries
- Decorative lines positioned for single-line text but title wrapped to two lines
- Source citations or footers colliding with content above
- Elements too close (< 0.3" gaps) or cards/sections nearly touching
- Uneven gaps (large empty area in one place, cramped in another)
- Insufficient margin from slide edges (< 0.5")
- Columns or similar elements not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text (e.g., light gray text on cream-colored background)
- Low-contrast icons (e.g., dark icons on dark backgrounds without a contrasting circle)
- Text boxes too narrow causing excessive wrapping
- Leftover placeholder content

For each slide, list issues or areas of concern, even if minor.

Read and analyze these images:
1. /path/to/slide-01.jpg (Expected: [brief description])
2. /path/to/slide-02.jpg (Expected: [brief description])

Report ALL issues found, including minor ones.
```

### Verification Loop

1. Generate slides → Convert to images → Inspect
2. **List issues found** (if none found, look again more critically)
3. Fix issues
4. **Re-verify affected slides** — one fix often creates another problem
5. Repeat until a full pass reveals no new issues

**Do not declare success until you've completed at least one fix-and-verify cycle.**

## Converting to Images

Convert presentations to individual slide images for visual inspection:

```bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf output.pptx
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 output.pdf slide
```

This creates `slide-01.jpg`, `slide-02.jpg`, etc.

To re-render specific slides after fixes:

```bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f N -l N output.pdf slide-fixed
```
